From early community donations, developers coding through the night, and the ops team building from scratch, to now—standing here, able to clearly declare our direction to the world—none of this could have happened without the trust of early investors and the tireless dedication of every team member.</p>\n<p>Over the past year, we’ve built out the foundational components of the mainnet and pioneered a new threefold narrative: <strong>Real World Assets (RWA) × <a  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://docs.xone.org/bvi/readme%22\">Behavior Value Index (BVI)</a> × <a  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://xid.world/en\">Decentralized Identity (DID)</a></strong>. Alongside that, we’ve laid the groundwork for <a  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://xdao123.org\">DAO governance</a>. We believe this industry is evolving from speculation to utility, where user behavior and asset authenticity define the next phase of competition. And <strong>Xone is built to lead that transformation.</strong></p>\n<p>A place where <strong>real behavior creates real value</strong>, and every contributor is seen.</p>\n<p>Today, we move beyond vision and deliver a clear, actionable roadmap: <strong>The \"Sunflower Alliance Three Initiatives.\"</strong></p>\n<h2>Industry Context &#x26; Xone’s Breakthrough</h2>\n<p>We live with a stark reality: While 430 million people are already in the crypto world, over 7.5 billion still lack an on-chain identity. Around 1.4 billion adults remain unbanked. In Nigeria, 36 million people are excluded from the financial system. In Africa, stablecoins serve as grassroots savings. In the Philippines, 12 million migrant workers lose 6–10% of their earnings to remittance fees. For them, stablecoins aren’t a trend—they’re a necessity.</p>\n<p>Despite a crowded L1 market, most blockchains still operate under an outdated “trading = ecosystem” model. User behavior isn’t incentivized; assets remain native and disconnected from real-world value.</p>\n<p><strong>Xone chooses the hard but right path</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Built on EVM + cross-chain interoperability</li>\n<li>Anchored by cash-flowing RWAs</li>\n<li>Powered by <a  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://docs.xone.org/bvi/readme\">BVI behavioral incentives</a></li>\n<li>Governed by <a  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://xid.world/en\">DID-based digital sovereignty</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We aim to make wallets function like rural Alipay: <strong>one-click onboarding, low-cost usage, visible returns, and respect for users.</strong></p>\n<p>Supply is growing—on-chain dollars, tokenized treasuries, institutional RWAs. But demand calls for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lower barriers</li>\n<li>Stronger compliance</li>\n<li>A Web2-like experience</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The real growth of Web3 in 2025 lies in connecting both ends.</strong></p>\n<p>This is the origin of the <strong>Sunflower Initiative</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Real users, real behavior, real value, real revenue.</strong></p>\n<p>Because true growth only comes from anchoring in the real.</p>\n<p>Let’s bring light to where the world needs Web3 most.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://xone-docs.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/blog/bulletin/world.png\" alt=\"world\"></p>\n<h2>Overview of the Three Sunflower Alliance Initiatives</h2>\n<p>In Web3, many chase short-term hype. Few build for real users, real assets, and real identity.</p>\n<p>We don’t want Xone to be just a “tech platform.”</p>\n<p>We want it to be a <strong>living ecosystem</strong>—a place to entrust your time, assets, and trust.</p>\n<p>This is not a marketing campaign. It’s a <strong>systematic ecological launch.</strong></p>\n<p>The three initiatives form a flywheel of <strong>Assets–Ecosystem–Users</strong>, working in harmony:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>🌻 <strong>Sunflower Initiative</strong> = User Growth</li>\n<li>🐻 <strong>Taiji Bear Initiative</strong> = Asset Growth</li>\n<li>🐦 <strong>Phoenix Initiative</strong> = Ecosystem Growth</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This forms the <strong>true moat of Xone</strong>: a network of real value.</p>\n<h3>Mission of the Three Initiatives</h3>\n<p>From Day One, we sow the seeds of long-term prosperity:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RWA</strong>: Real value anchors</li>\n<li><strong><a  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://docs.xone.org/bvi/readme\">BVI</a></strong>: Track and reward every real action</li>\n<li><strong><a  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://xid.world/en\">DID</a></strong>: Give users visibility and power on-chain</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The Three Sunflower Alliance Initiatives</strong> are not just a plan — They are a clear, phased blueprint for real-world execution.</p>\n<h2>From One Seed to a Field of Sunflowers: The Xone Growth Roadmap</h2>\n<p>We’ve outlined four interconnected stages to grow Xone into a thriving field of sunflowers:</p>\n<h3>🌱 Sowing – Crafting the Narrative, Gathering Consensus</h3>\n<p>Every field begins with carefully chosen seeds.</p>\n<p>Now, our core task is to tell a unique story—<strong>RWA, <a  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://docs.xone.org/bvi/readme\">BVI</a>, <a  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://xid.world/en\">DID</a></strong>—to attract the first believers.</p>\n<p>You are the first seeds. You are the beginning of everything.</p>\n<h3>☀️ Growing – Activating Behavior, Igniting the Flywheel</h3>\n<p>Seeds need sunlight to grow. For Xone, that sunlight is <strong>real user activity</strong>.</p>\n<p>We’ll activate behavior through:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://x-zone.io/\">XZone's referral engine</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://xdao123.org\">XDAO’s staking governance</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://docs.xone.org/bvi/readme#gameplay-and-rules\">BVI mining</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Together, these will fuel user growth and vibrant community interaction.</p>\n<h3>🌿 Rooting – Anchoring Assets, Reinforcing Value</h3>\n<p>Sunflowers need deep roots to weather storms.</p>\n<p>To solidify value, we’ll focus on <strong>asset anchoring</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bridge assets via <a  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://swapx.exchange/en\">SwapX</a> and <a  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://rainlink.co/\">RainLink</a></li>\n<li>Launch sustainable <strong>off-chain cash flow</strong> through RWA issuance via <strong>IRO Network</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These will embed real-world value into the Xone network.</p>\n<h3>🌼 Blooming – Ecosystem Expansion, Welcoming the Future</h3>\n<p>With strong roots and thriving growth, flowers bloom.</p>\n<p>In this final phase:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://tokenup.org/en\">TokenUp</a></strong> becomes the user gateway</li>\n<li><strong>Labs Incubator</strong> supports a wave of new apps</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We’ll be ready to absorb and amplify real momentum.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://xone-docs.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/blog/bulletin/plate.png\" alt=\"plate\"></p>\n<h2>Your Role: Be a Sunflower Seeder</h2>\n<p>This letter is both a blueprint and an invitation.</p>\n<p>We don’t need bystanders—we need builders.</p>\n<p><strong>We need “sunflower seeders.”</strong></p>\n<p>Every time you believe, you water the seed.</p>\n<p>Every real action you take helps it grow.</p>\n<p>Every share you make brings more people to the field.</p>\n<p>This path may be “slow,” but it leads to a truly prosperous, sustainable future.</p>\n<p>We choose the hard but right path—because only value that withstands time is worth pursuing.</p>\n<h2>Who We Invite on This Journey</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Token Holders</strong>: Stake in Xone DAO, vote, participate, and earn from BVI and ecosystem revenue. From “Sunflower Seeds” to “Governors of the Starsea,” governance power grows through staking and real contribution.</li>\n<li><strong>Developers</strong>: <a  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://docs.xone.org/study/grants\">Apply for Grants</a>, join Labs, integrate XID, stablecoin, or cross-chain modules—deploy on Xone Chain.</li>\n<li><strong>Channel Nodes &#x26; City Ambassadors</strong>: Onboard local users and drive ecosystem/asset/KPI growth.</li>\n<li><strong>Impact Partners</strong>: Collaborate with Xone’s social initiatives in emerging markets, promoting financial inclusion and tech employment.
