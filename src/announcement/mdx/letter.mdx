# A Letter from Sunflower | To All Builders of the Xone Community

![banner](https://xone-docs.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/blog/bulletin/letter_banner.png)

**The “Sunflower Alliance Three Initiatives” officially launch** – Xone | Co-creating a life of true value
<br/>
A growth pact for dreamers, creators, and all who believe in real value.

## Foreword｜Looking Back, Grounded in the Present, Heading Toward the Future

As this letter reaches you, Xone has completed a year of silent but steadfast progress. From early community donations, developers coding through the night, and the ops team building from scratch, to now—standing here, able to clearly declare our direction to the world—none of this could have happened without the trust of early investors and the tireless dedication of every team member.

Over the past year, we’ve built out the foundational components of the mainnet and pioneered a new threefold narrative: **Real World Assets (RWA) × [Behavior Value Index (BVI)](https://docs.xone.org/bvi/readme") × [Decentralized Identity (DID)](https://xid.world/en)**. Alongside that, we’ve laid the groundwork for [DAO governance](https://xdao123.org). We believe this industry is evolving from speculation to utility, where user behavior and asset authenticity define the next phase of competition. And **Xone is built to lead that transformation.**

A place where **real behavior creates real value**, and every contributor is seen.

Today, we move beyond vision and deliver a clear, actionable roadmap: **The "Sunflower Alliance Three Initiatives."**

## Industry Context & Xone’s Breakthrough

We live with a stark reality: While 430 million people are already in the crypto world, over 7.5 billion still lack an on-chain identity. Around 1.4 billion adults remain unbanked. In Nigeria, 36 million people are excluded from the financial system. In Africa, stablecoins serve as grassroots savings. In the Philippines, 12 million migrant workers lose 6–10% of their earnings to remittance fees. For them, stablecoins aren’t a trend—they’re a necessity.

Despite a crowded L1 market, most blockchains still operate under an outdated “trading = ecosystem” model. User behavior isn’t incentivized; assets remain native and disconnected from real-world value.

**Xone chooses the hard but right path**:

* Built on EVM + cross-chain interoperability
* Anchored by cash-flowing RWAs
* Powered by [BVI behavioral incentives](https://docs.xone.org/bvi/readme)
* Governed by [DID-based digital sovereignty](https://xid.world/en)

We aim to make wallets function like rural Alipay: **one-click onboarding, low-cost usage, visible returns, and respect for users.**

Supply is growing—on-chain dollars, tokenized treasuries, institutional RWAs. But demand calls for:

* Lower barriers
* Stronger compliance
* A Web2-like experience

**The real growth of Web3 in 2025 lies in connecting both ends.**

This is the origin of the **Sunflower Initiative**:

**Real users, real behavior, real value, real revenue.**

Because true growth only comes from anchoring in the real.

Let’s bring light to where the world needs Web3 most.

## Overview of the Three Sunflower Alliance Initiatives

In Web3, many chase short-term hype. Few build for real users, real assets, and real identity.

We don’t want Xone to be just a “tech platform.”

We want it to be a **living ecosystem**—a place to entrust your time, assets, and trust.

This is not a marketing campaign. It’s a **systematic ecological launch.**

The three initiatives form a flywheel of **Assets–Ecosystem–Users**, working in harmony:

* 🌻 **Sunflower Initiative** = User Growth
* 🐻 **Taiji Bear Initiative** = Asset Growth
* 🐦 **Phoenix Initiative** = Ecosystem Growth

This forms the **true moat of Xone**: a network of real value.

### Mission of the Three Initiatives

From Day One, we sow the seeds of long-term prosperity:

* **RWA**: Real value anchors
* **[BVI](https://docs.xone.org/bvi/readme)**: Track and reward every real action
* **[DID](https://xid.world/en)**: Give users visibility and power on-chain

**The Three Sunflower Alliance Initiatives** are not just a plan — They are a clear, phased blueprint for real-world execution.


## From One Seed to a Field of Sunflowers: The Xone Growth Roadmap

We’ve outlined four interconnected stages to grow Xone into a thriving field of sunflowers:

### 🌱 Sowing – Crafting the Narrative, Gathering Consensus

Every field begins with carefully chosen seeds.

Now, our core task is to tell a unique story—**RWA, [BVI](https://docs.xone.org/bvi/readme), [DID](https://xid.world/en)**—to attract the first believers.

You are the first seeds. You are the beginning of everything.

### ☀️ Growing – Activating Behavior, Igniting the Flywheel

Seeds need sunlight to grow. For Xone, that sunlight is **real user activity**.

We’ll activate behavior through:

* **[XZone's referral engine](https://x-zone.io/)**
* **[XDAO’s staking governance](https://xdao123.org)**
* **[BVI mining](https://docs.xone.org/bvi/readme#gameplay-and-rules)**

Together, these will fuel user growth and vibrant community interaction.

### 🌿 Rooting – Anchoring Assets, Reinforcing Value

Sunflowers need deep roots to weather storms.

To solidify value, we’ll focus on **asset anchoring**:

* Bridge assets via [SwapX](https://swapx.exchange/en) and [RainLink](https://rainlink.co/)
* Launch sustainable **off-chain cash flow** through RWA issuance via **IRO Network**

These will embed real-world value into the Xone network.

### 🌼 Blooming – Ecosystem Expansion, Welcoming the Future

With strong roots and thriving growth, flowers bloom.

In this final phase:

* **[TokenUp](https://tokenup.org/en)** becomes the user gateway
* **Labs Incubator** supports a wave of new apps

We’ll be ready to absorb and amplify real momentum.

## Your Role: Be a Sunflower Seeder

This letter is both a blueprint and an invitation.

We don’t need bystanders—we need builders.

**We need “sunflower seeders.”**

Every time you believe, you water the seed.

Every real action you take helps it grow.

Every share you make brings more people to the field.

This path may be “slow,” but it leads to a truly prosperous, sustainable future.

We choose the hard but right path—because only value that withstands time is worth pursuing.


## Who We Invite on This Journey

* **Token Holders**: Stake in Xone DAO, vote, participate, and earn from BVI and ecosystem revenue. From “Sunflower Seeds” to “Governors of the Starsea,” governance power grows through staking and real contribution.
* **Developers**: [Apply for Grants](https://docs.xone.org/study/grants), join Labs, integrate XID, stablecoin, or cross-chain modules—deploy on Xone Chain.
* **Channel Nodes & City Ambassadors**: Onboard local users and drive ecosystem/asset/KPI growth.
* **Impact Partners**: Collaborate with Xone’s social initiatives in emerging markets, promoting financial inclusion and tech employment. Contributions are quantified and rewarded via BVI—so goodwill is recognized, and global impact made visible.

**Q4 of 2025** marks the first chapter of Xone’s transformation.

Let us unite under the banner of the **Three Sunflower Alliance Initiatives**, and together nurture a golden future—for all of us.


## Our Vision

One day, you’ll see that **Xone is a place where**:

* Token holders aren’t just investors—they’re the sunlight of the ecosystem.
* Developers aren’t just coders—they’re the rain that nourishes the roots.
* Everyday users aren’t just bystanders—they’re co-creators of value.

Here, your contributions are seen and remembered.

You’ll earn enduring value from your identity, behavior, and assets on-chain.

Let’s grow together — Anchored in RWA, Driven by [BVI](https://docs.xone.org/bvi/readme), Governed by [DID](https://xid.world/en).
<br/>

Toward real value, facing the sun. Us ready when you are. 🚀
